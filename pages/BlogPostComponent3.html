        <h1>What is Digital Transformation? Definition for Businesses</h1>
        <h6>Last Updated: April 7, 2022</h6>

            <p>Since digital transformation looks different for every company, pinpointing a general definition is challenging. In its essence, digital transformation is the process of integrating digital solutions into various areas of business. This changes how your company operates and delivers value to customers.

                On the surface, the digital transformation seems to be about the increasing use of technology to improve the experience of employees, customers, and other stakeholders.
                
                But digital transformation isn’t only about technology. It’s also a cultural change that moves organizations towards a culture that:
                
                encourages experimentation,
                challenges the status quo,
                allows failure to become part of the process.
                Digital transformation involves a change in leadership styles and leads to reinventing the business models to serve customer needs better.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>Even though digital transformation will take on different shapes and sizes based on the specific needs and challenges of your company, there are a few common themes in such projects.

                These issues lead to the development of digital transformation frameworks business leaders can use.
                
                Here are four examples of inspiring digital transformation frameworks:
                
                A Framework for Digital Business Transformation (Cognizant)
                The Nine Elements of Digital Transformation (MIT Sloan)
                Six Stages of Digital Transformation (Altimeter)
                A Step-By-Step Guide to Digital Transformation (Iconology)</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>Digital transformation is a holistic process that doesn’t just happen overnight. It’s made of many different components and intermediate goals that mark key moments in the incremental implementation of digital strategies.</p>
