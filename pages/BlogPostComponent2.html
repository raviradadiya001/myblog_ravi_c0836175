            <p>Privacy policy is a document containing information on how your mobile app handles the personal information of its users. Privacy policy may be a document of legal importance if it is required to be drafted by certain laws. This does not necessarily mean that it should be written fully in legal language. On the contrary, privacy policy is a document intended primarily for users of your app, which means it should be easy to understand, written in plain language, user-oriented and user-friendly. Can this be made consistent with legal requirements? Without a hitch: some of the applicable privacy laws require all information intended for users to be very clear and even not too long.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>A privacy policy is needed regardless of the place where you run your business or the type of app you are planning to build.Besides the fact that a well written privacy policy is a great tool to reach out to your users and address their privacy concerns, as mentioned above, a privacy policy is often a legal requirement which can arise from applicable privacy laws, app stores’ requirements or third-party service providers’ requirements.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>Who collects the personal data (identity of the controller).

                The source of the personal data.

                For how long the data will be stored.
                To whom the data is transferred, if applicable.</p> 
            &nbsp;
                <p>Given our professional experience with mobile app users, we advise that your privacy policy is written in a user-friendly, plain way (if it is not necessary, avoid using any legal or technical jargon);
                    is divided into clear sections;
                    includes a cookie policy and third-party service providers’ information;
